How the program was written:
Memory utilization was calculated using <sys/sysinfo.h>, namely using variables totalram and freeram of struct sysinfo

CPU utilization was calculated by going to /proc/stat and dividing the idle time by the total time of the CPU

Number of CPUs was calculated by going to /sys/devices/system/cpu and iterating through the cpu0, cpu1, ..., 
located there to find the max cpu number

Max frequency was calculated by going to /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq and converting from Khz to Ghz

How To Use Program:
1. gcc myMonitoringTool -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -o myMonitoringTool
2. ./myMonitoringTool  [samples [tdelay]] [--memory] [--cpu] [--cores] [--samples=N] [--tdelay=T]
Notes
Same arguments can be used. ie ./myMonitoringTool --cpu --cpu
The leftmost values will be used. ie ./myMonitoringTool 20 --samples=30 will run the program with samples = 30
Another example, ./myMonitoringTool --tdelay=2000 --tdelay=1000 will run the program with tdelay = 1000
